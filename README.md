Purpose of this demo is to explore:

- if `vite` can be hidden away from developers who consume an app
- if/ how `vite-plugin-ssr` can be utilized to load routes + configuration from a dependency (v1 design)
- what a page extension API with `vite-plugin-ssr` could look like (pages directory)

See full instructions in `apps/dev`.
